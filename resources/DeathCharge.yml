#This is the default config for [DeathCharge]

#========================================================
# Amount determines the amount or
# percentage lost when a player dies.
#
# Use a % sign in the quotations if
# you would like to charge a percentage.
#
# Use no sign if you would like to charge
# an amount
#
#    IMPORTANT: Must be in quotation marks
#
# Example:
#    amount: "5.00%"
#    Player will lose 5 percent of
#    their money on death
#
#    amount: "5.00"
#    Player will lose $5 of their
#    money on death
amount: "5.00%"

# Determines if the plugin will drain
# remaining funds (set balance to 0)
# if a player does not have enough
# money to pay the charge
#
# NOTE: only applies if the above
#       variable is not a percentage
drain: false
